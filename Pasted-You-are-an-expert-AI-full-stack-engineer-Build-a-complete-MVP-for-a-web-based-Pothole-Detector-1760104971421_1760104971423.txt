You are an expert AI + full-stack engineer.
Build a complete MVP for a **web-based Pothole Detector** app that detects potholes in real time from a phone or laptop camera.

---

### 🧩 GOAL
Create a working **web application** (not a mobile app) with:
- A **FastAPI backend** that loads a **pre-trained pothole detection model** (e.g. YOLOv8 trained on a pothole dataset from Roboflow or Kaggle).
- A **browser-based frontend** that:
  - Accesses the device camera (phone or laptop) using `getUserMedia()`.
  - Streams frames to the FastAPI backend (`/detect` endpoint).
  - Displays the live video feed with bounding boxes drawn over detected potholes.

---

### ⚙️ REQUIREMENTS

#### BACKEND (FastAPI)
- Load a **public pre-trained model** for pothole detection, such as:
  - `ultralytics/yolov8n` fine-tuned on a public pothole dataset.
  - or use model weights hosted on Hugging Face or Roboflow.
- Implement the `/detect` endpoint:
  - Accepts a frame via POST (as base64 image or multipart form-data).
  - Runs inference using the model.
  - Returns detection results as JSON:
    ```json
    {
      "detections": [
        {"label": "pothole", "confidence": 0.89, "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2]},
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```
- Use `uvicorn` to serve the app.
- Add **CORS middleware** for browser access.

#### FRONTEND (Web UI)
- Use **HTML + JavaScript** (no frameworks needed, keep it simple).
- Use the browser’s **`navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`** to capture live video.
- Every few frames (e.g. 3 fps), send the frame as a base64 image to the FastAPI `/detect` endpoint.
- Display the annotated stream by:
  - Drawing bounding boxes on a `<canvas>` overlay.
  - Showing confidence and labels.

#### OPTIONAL FEATURES
- Toggle between **laptop camera** and **phone camera** (use same web URL — the browser handles it).
- Button to start/stop detection.
- Responsive layout for mobile/laptop screens.
- Display real-time FPS and detection confidence.

### 📦 TECH STACK
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Ultralytics YOLOv8 (pre-trained model), OpenCV, Pydantic, Uvicorn.
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML, CSS, JS, Canvas API.
- **Dependencies:** `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `ultralytics`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`.

---

### 🚀 DELIVERABLES
1. **`main.py`** – FastAPI backend serving `/detect` API.
2. **`index.html`** – Frontend page with live camera preview and detection overlay.
3. **`static/script.js`** – Handles camera capture and API communication.
4. **`requirements.txt`** – Dependencies.
5. Instructions to:
   - Run locally (`uvicorn main:app --reload`).
   - Open `http://localhost:8000` on a laptop or phone.
   - Select camera and start live detection.

---

### 💡 MVP BEHAVIOR
- Open the site → allow camera access → see live video.
- The backend detects potholes using the pre-trained model.
- Boxes + confidence drawn in real-time.
- Works on any device with a browser (laptop/phone/tablet).

---

### 🧱 FUTURE EXPANSIONS
- Add GPS tagging of detected potholes.
- Store detection data in SQLite/Postgres.
- Add heatmap visualization of pothole density on a map (e.g., using Leaflet.js).
- Support multi-user backend.

---

### 🧰 OUTPUT EXPECTATION
Generate:
- All backend and frontend code (main.py, index.html, script.js).
- Clear explanation for setup and running.
- Include a note on which pre-trained model is used (and how to change it if needed).
- Code should be modular, well-commented, and production-ready for local deployment.
